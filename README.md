# Translate Numbers to Words

### By Meaghan Jones and Brett New, July 2016

## Description 

We wrote a method that translates numbers in numeric form into written words. For example, it would translate 384 into "three hundred eighty four". We used multiple hashes and the .fetch() method to solve this.

We got our code working for numbers up to 1 trillion.
